## My Contributions & Projects

### Cilium - Cloud Native Networking, Security & Observability
As a contributor to the Cilium project (CNCF Incubating), I've delivered upstream patches to improve Gateway API integration, with my work now shipped in official Cilium releasesâ€”actively supporting production-grade Kubernetes networking.

Key Contributions:
- Fixed Gateway reconciler failure when TLSRoute CRD is not installed ([#38874](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/38874))
- Improved parentRefMatched logic to correctly validate Gateway Group and Kind ([#39275](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/39275))
- My contributions have been included in official Cilium releases (e.g., v1.17.4, v1.18.0-pre.2, v1.18.0-pre.3). You can find more of my work on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/syedazeez337).

### go-exhaustruct - Enhancing Developer Experience
Contributed to improving the contributor workflow for the `go-exhaustruct` static analysis tool by designing and integrating structured GitHub Issue and Feature Request templates ([PR #117](https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/go-exhaustruct/pull/117)). These templates streamline bug reporting and feature suggestions, fostering clearer communication and better project maintainability.
